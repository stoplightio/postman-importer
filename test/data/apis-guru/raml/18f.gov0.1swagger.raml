  <p>This API drives the <a href="https://discovery.gsa.gov">Discovery Market Research Tool</a>.
  It contains information on the vendors that are part of the OASIS and OASIS Small Business contracting vehicles, such as their contracting history, their elligibility for contract awards, and their small business designations.
  To learn more about the tool, please visit <a href="https://discovery.gsa.gov">Discovery</a> or see the README on our <a href="https://github.com/18F/mirage">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Please note that the base path for this API is <code>https://api.data.gov/gsa/discovery/</code></strong></p>
  <p>It requires an API key, obtainable at <a href="http://api.data.gov/">api.data.gov</a>.
  It must be passed in the <code>api_key</code> parameter with each request.</p>

        description: |-
          <p>This endpoint returns a list of vendors filtered by a NAICS code. The NAICS code maps to an OASIS pool and is used to retrieve vendors in that pool only.</p>
          <p>OASIS pools are groupings of NAICS codes that have the same small business size standard. Because contracts solicited to OASIS vendors can only be issued to one pool, much of the data is presented as part of a pool grouping. Using the NAICS code is a shortcut, so that you don't have to explicitly map the NAICS code to a pool in OASIS yourself.</p>
          <p>Vendors can also be filtered by a particular setaside. Valid values for the setasides are two-character codes which include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>A6 (8(a))</li>
          <li>XX (Hubzone)</li>
          <li>QF (service disabled veteran owned)</li>
          <li>A2 (women owned)</li>
          <li>A5 (veteran owned)</li>
          <li>27 (small disadvantaged business).  </li>
